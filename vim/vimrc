" Minimal configuration file for Vim on CoreOS
"
" The vim package is installed with USE=minimal to avoid installing lots of
" extra files but that doesn't mean we like vim acting as if it were vi.

" General settings from Gentoo's default vimrc:
set nocompatible        " Use Vim defaults (much better!)
set bs=2                " Allow backspacing over everything in insert mode
set ruler               " Show the cursor position all the time
set nomodeline          " We don't allow modelines by default

" Read vimrc from the state partition if it exists. (read-only root images)
if filereadable("/media/state/etc/vim/vimrc")
  source /media/state/etc/vim/vimrc
endif
if filereadable("/media/state/etc/vim/vimrc.local")
  source /media/state/etc/vim/vimrc.local
endif

" Read vimrc.local from /etc if it exists. (read-write root images)
if filereadable("/etc/vim/vimrc.local")
  source /etc/vim/vimrc.local
endif
